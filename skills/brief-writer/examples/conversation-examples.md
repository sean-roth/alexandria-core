# Brief Writer Conversation Examples

Extended examples showing the brief-writer skill in action.

## Example A: Law School Prep

**User**: I should probably start learning some law before law school.

**Brief-Writer**: Smart to get a head start. Chicago-Kent's evening program starts fall 2027, so you have time to build a foundation. A few questions:

1. Are you thinking "law school survival skills" (how to read cases, legal writing, exam techniques) or actual substantive law (contracts, torts, constitutional law)?

2. For substantive law — do you want a broad survey of 1L subjects, or go deep on one area that interests you?

**User**: Probably 1L subjects since that's what I'll face first. But not too deep — I'll learn it properly in school.

**Brief-Writer**: Makes sense — you want orientation, not mastery. The core 1L subjects are typically:
- Contracts
- Torts
- Civil Procedure
- Criminal Law
- Constitutional Law
- Property
- Legal Research & Writing

I could write briefs to gather intro-level resources for each, focusing on:
- Open casebooks (real law school materials, but free)
- Foundational concepts rather than exhaustive case law
- "Understanding X Law" style guides

Want one mega-brief covering all 1L subjects, or separate briefs so you can tackle them one at a time?

**User**: Separate briefs, I'll work through them over time.

**Brief-Writer**: I'll generate 7 briefs — one per subject — each targeting 8-12 sources at intro/orientation depth. They'll prioritize CALI casebooks and similar open resources since those are what you'd actually use in law school.

Starting with Contracts (usually the first 1L course). Here's the brief:

```yaml
# Research Brief: Contracts Law - 1L Preparation
# Generated by brief-writer

task_id: law-1l-contracts-001

domain: law
subdomain: contracts

objective: |
  Gather introductory resources on U.S. contract law suitable for 
  pre-law school preparation. Focus on foundational concepts and 
  orientation rather than exhaustive coverage. Target audience is 
  an incoming 1L student who wants familiarity with core doctrines
  before formal instruction begins.

priority_topics:
  - contract formation (offer, acceptance, consideration)
  - defenses to formation (capacity, duress, unconscionability)
  - statute of frauds
  - parol evidence rule
  - contract interpretation
  - breach and remedies
  - third party beneficiaries
  - assignment and delegation

    Part of 1L preparation series. Sean targeting Chicago-Kent
    evening program fall 2027. Orientation depth, not mastery.
    Will generate 6 more briefs for other 1L subjects.
```

Want me to continue with Torts, or adjust anything on this one first?

## Example B: Business Operations

**User**: What do I need to know about running an LLC?

**Brief-Writer**: Depends on where you are in the process. Are you:
- Thinking about forming one (haven't yet)?
- Already have one and want to run it properly?
- Comparing LLC vs other structures (S-corp, sole prop)?

**User**: I have SOPs Nobody Reads as a sole prop, wondering if I should convert to LLC.

**Brief-Writer**: Classic question. The research would cover:

1. **LLC vs Sole Prop comparison** — liability protection, tax treatment, administrative burden
2. **Colorado LLC formation** — since you're currently in CO
3. **Illinois LLC** — if you're moving, might form there instead
4. **Single-member LLC taxation** — the "disregarded entity" default vs S-corp election
5. **Operating agreements** — even for single-member, why you want one

Are you leaning toward forming in Colorado (where you are now) or waiting to see about Illinois?

**User**: Probably wait for Illinois since I might move.

**Brief-Writer**: Smart — avoid forming in one state then having to register as a foreign LLC in another. I'll write a brief that covers:
- General LLC fundamentals (jurisdiction-agnostic)
- Illinois-specific formation requirements
- Colorado requirements (lighter coverage, for comparison)
- Tax implications of single-member LLC
- Operating agreement essentials

```yaml
# Research Brief: LLC Formation and Operations
# Generated by brief-writer

task_id: business-llc-formation-001

domain: business
subdomain: entity-formation

objective: |
  Research LLC formation and operations for a single-member consulting
  business. Primary focus on Illinois (likely formation state) with 
  secondary coverage of Colorado. Help evaluate LLC vs sole proprietorship
  and understand ongoing compliance requirements.

priority_topics:
  - LLC vs sole proprietorship (liability, taxes, admin)
  - single-member LLC tax treatment (disregarded entity)
  - S-corp election for LLC (when it makes sense)
  - Illinois LLC formation process
  - Illinois annual report and fees
  - operating agreement (even for single member)
  - registered agent requirements
  - Colorado LLC basics (for comparison)

## Example C: Technical Research

**User**: I want Clara to understand machine learning well enough to help me with Compel English's adaptive learning system.

**Brief-Writer**: Interesting use case — Clara as a technical collaborator. Let me understand the scope:

1. What's already built vs. what's planned? Is the adaptive system designed, or are you still architecting it?

2. What ML approaches are you considering? (Reinforcement learning for adaptation? NLP for text analysis? Recommendation systems?)

3. How technical should Clara's knowledge be? "Explain concepts" level or "help debug implementations" level?

**User**: The design exists but implementation hasn't started. Probably spaced repetition plus some kind of skill modeling. Clara should understand the concepts well enough to discuss tradeoffs, not necessarily debug code.

**Brief-Writer**: So conceptual depth on:
- Spaced repetition algorithms (SM-2, FSRS, etc.)
- Knowledge/skill modeling (Bayesian knowledge tracing, IRT)
- Adaptive learning system design patterns
- Maybe some ed-tech specific ML papers

Not needed:
- Deep neural network architectures
- Implementation tutorials
- General ML textbooks

That sound right?

**User**: Yeah, focused on the adaptive learning domain specifically.

**Brief-Writer**: 

```yaml
# Research Brief: Adaptive Learning Systems
# Generated by brief-writer

task_id: tech-adaptive-learning-001

domain: technology
subdomain: educational-technology

objective: |
  Build Clara's knowledge of adaptive learning systems for intelligent
  tutoring. Focus on algorithms and design patterns relevant to 
  Compel English (ESL tutoring app). Conceptual understanding for 
  discussing tradeoffs, not implementation-level detail.

priority_topics:
  - spaced repetition algorithms (SM-2, FSRS, Leitner)
  - knowledge tracing (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, Deep KT)
  - item response theory (IRT) for skill assessment
  - mastery-based progression
  - adaptive difficulty adjustment
  - learner modeling approaches
  - cold start problem in educational contexts
  - forgetting curves and retention modeling

quality_criteria:
  require_open_access: true
  prefer_primary_sources: true  # Original papers where accessible
  recent_threshold_years: 7
  acceptable_licenses:
    - public-domain
    - cc-by
    - cc-by-sa

  max_sources: 20
  max_full_ingests: 12

search_hints:
  start_with:
    - https://arxiv.org/
    - https://educationaldatamining.org/
  exclude_sources:
    - General ML/DL textbooks (too broad)
    - Vendor whitepapers (marketing)
    - Implementation tutorials (not conceptual)

## Example D: Quick Specific Request

**User**: Get me the IRS publications on estimated taxes.

**Brief-Writer**: Straightforward. Just confirming:
- Self-employment context (Schedule SE + estimated payments)?
- Any state-level estimated tax info needed (Colorado/Illinois)?

**User**: Just federal for now.

**Brief-Writer**: Got it. This is narrow enough I can generate immediately:

```yaml
# Research Brief: IRS Estimated Tax Publications
# Generated by brief-writer

task_id: tax-estimated-federal-001

domain: law
subdomain: taxation

objective: |
  Gather IRS publications and guidance on federal estimated tax
  payments for self-employed individuals.

priority_topics:
  - Form 1040-ES and instructions
  - estimated tax calculation
  - payment deadlines and schedules
  - safe harbor rules
  - underpayment penalties

quality_criteria:
  require_open_access: true
  prefer_primary_sources: true
  acceptable_licenses:
    - government

scope:
  jurisdiction: united-states-federal
