  notes: |
    Sean is considering moving to Chicago. Chicago has one of the strongest
    tenant protection ordinances in the country - significantly different
    from Illinois state law and from Colorado. Need to understand the
    specifics of Chicago RLTO (city), Cook County RTLO (suburban), and
    keep Colorado knowledge for existing connections there.
